# BlueJ-Themes
Repository themes for the editor of BlueJ 4.0 or higher.
This repository contains the files moe.defs and bluej.defs which contain the properties of the colors used by the IDE.
If you want to change the appearance of the editor so that you can see how one of the themes in this repository only sees C: \ Program Files (x86) \ BlueJ \ lib and replaces the moe.defs and bluej.defs files with Are found in the repository folders.
If you have BlueJ open you have to restart it to visualize the changes.
